  What does the worker gain from his toil? 10 I have seen the burden God has
  laid on men.11 He has made everything beautiful in its time.He has also set
  eternity in the hearts of men; yet they cannot fathom what God has done from
  beginning to end. 12 I know that there is nothing better for men than to be
  happy and do good while they live. 13 That everyone may eat and drink, and
  find satisfaction in all his toilâ€”this is the gift of God.
