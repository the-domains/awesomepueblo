# Setting up a priority queue for emails coming from Internal employees

Created an Internal communication queue to have emails from employees sent to.

Set up the \#1 routing rule... Case: Web EmailCONTAINS@confirmation.com  
To send those cases to the new queue.

Updated Routing Configurations - Routing priority \#1 for cases in the new queue.
