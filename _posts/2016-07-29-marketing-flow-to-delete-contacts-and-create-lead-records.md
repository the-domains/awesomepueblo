# Marketing Flow to Delete Contacts and Create Lead records

Creating Flows and Processes.

Created a Process that kicks off a Flow.

The process runs when a contact record owned by one of the marketing reps is created or edited. She shouldn't own any contacts but instead should own those contacts as leads.

The process starts a flow that grabs the contact ID from the triggered process, assigns many of the fields on the contact record as variables, deletes the contact record and then creates a lead record with the same info and assigns it to the same rep.
